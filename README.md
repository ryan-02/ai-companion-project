# EchoPal – AI Study Companion Growth Test

## 1. Product Concept

**Product Name:** EchoPal  
**Type:** AI study companion chatbot  
**Target Audience:** College students (18–24)  
**Value Proposition:** EchoPal helps students stay focused and motivated by simulating a friendly, conversational study partner. It adds personality to reminders and breaks down studying into small, gamified challenges.

### Core Features:
- Conversational AI that feels like a supportive friend
- Personalized study reminders
- Daily focus challenges
- Optional calendar integration (planned)

## 2. Landing Page Mockup

Created a simple landing page using HTML/CSS to introduce EchoPal and collect interest.

**Goals:**
- Test if students are interested in the idea
- Measure click-throughs on CTA ("Join Beta")

**Page Sections:**
- Headline: “Meet EchoPal – Your Study Buddy with Personality”
- Subtext: “Stay on track. Beat procrastination. Get encouragement from an AI that actually sounds human.”
- Email Capture Form
- Testimonials from mock students (for credibility)

Demo Link (if hosted): *Coming soon*

## 3. Email Capture & Tracking Setup

Added an email form with mock validation (JS) and connected it to a mock Google Sheet for now. Used UTM parameters to simulate basic ad campaign data.

**Simulated Channels:**
- Instagram Ad
- Discord Post
- Campus Flyer QR Code

**Captured:**
- Email
- Source (utm_campaign)
- Timestamp

## 4. A/B Testing

Tested two variations of CTA text:

| Version | CTA Text                      | Conversion Rate |
|---------|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| A       | “Join Beta Now – It's Free”   | 28%             |
| B       | “Be One of the First 100 Users” | 42%             |

**Result:** Scarcity-based CTA (Version B) performed better. Would use this in future campaign iterations.

## 5. Summary & Learnings

- **What worked:** Framing the AI as a *friend* rather than just a tool boosted interest. Scarcity-based CTA improved email signups.
- **What to improve:** Would like to add a working chatbot demo using GPT and deploy to simulate actual usage.
- **Next steps:** Integrate Calendly or Google Calendar, and test AI responses with 5–10 real students.

## Why I Did This

Wanted to test growth hacking strategies in a practical way using something I'm personally interested in (AI + student tools). Even though this is a small mock project, it helped me practice things like CTA writing, email capture, and simple A/B testing logic — skills that are valuable for something I'm passionate in.
