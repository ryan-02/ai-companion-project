## 4. A/B CTA Test Results

Tested two versions of the call-to-action:

| Version | CTA Text                        | Conversion Rate |
|---------|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| A       | “Join Beta Now – It's Free”     | 28%             |
| B       | “Be One of the First 100 Users” | 42%             |

**Result:** Scarcity-based CTA (Version B) performed better and will be used moving forward.

## 💬 Why I Built This

I wanted to explore growth hacking and product validation using something I’d genuinely use as a student. This hands-on mock project gave me real practice in landing page design, A/B testing, tracking UTM data, and understanding what makes a product feel relatable. It helped me build growth and product skills I can apply in a real setting.
